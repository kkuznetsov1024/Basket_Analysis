# Basket_Analysis
Jupyter Notebook code in Python to analyze shopping trends for Instacart 

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect
on the sale of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to
ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
